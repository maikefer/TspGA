# TSP GA
This projects implements a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" target="_blank"> genetic algorithm </a> which tries to find an optimal soultion for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" target="_blank"> travelling salesman problem </a>. It provides example data for points in Berlin, for which a good solution would have a fitness of around 7000 - 8000. The project provides interfaces for selection strategies (e.g. Tournament Selection), crossover strategies (e.g. PMX, UOX) and mutation strategies (e.g. Swap Mutation) and will be further more extended in the nearer future.
